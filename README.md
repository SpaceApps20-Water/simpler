# simpler

Hi Guys.

This is what we will be starting with. Believe me it will be easier than previous stuff using complicated things. Now it is mainly Html, Materialize (like bootstrap) and JS. 
We could maybe integrate them but for now :

So to work with this:

Go to parent folder
Open command 
git clone https://github.com/SpaceApps20-Water/simpler.git

cd simpler

npm install

npm start

in visual studio, open folder -> locate the simpler folder, highlight and click open folder

then you have the code

The tasks: dividable per person

- Change all text, page names, links, button names, button links to suit the design
- Create pages suiting the design needs and link to them
- Change the cover picture to suite the design, style for the design
- Display needed data on the map. Add maps to other pages (steven)
- Transform the boxes with the text (free account, nosql databases, ... ) into buttons (these would like to different form pages for the planners)
- Create a fake dashboard
- Create the forms for the planners and one for volunteering citizens


Then we can add functionality:
Bring in the geocoder
Map layers with regions and alerts (would be very easy to just get a picture from online with alerts colors on regions)
Database connection for users, login, emergency events and responses
Data visualization : make PDFs from forms
Map data layers
